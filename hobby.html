<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<h2>Baseball</h2>
<p>One of my favorite sports is baseball. I am a huge Twins fan, and try to get to at least a few games each year. They haven't 
been very good the last few years, but I've loved cheering them on every step of the way. They are finally getting
back to their winning ways this year, and are currently in the hunt for a Wild Card playoff slot! I've been a fan of the 
team for my whole life, and I've watched a lot of players come and go. Here are my top 5 favorite Twins players 
that I have been able to see play in my life:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Justin Morneau</li>
    <li>Brian Dozier</li>
    <li>Michael Cuddyer</li>
    <li>Chris Herrmann</li>
    <li>Jim Thome</li>
</ol>

<p>I will always be a Twins fan first and foremost, but I am just a huge fan of baseball in general as well. One of my bucket 
list goals is to go to a game in every MLB ballpark. I've only been to a few, and I have a long ways to go. Here are the 
fields I have already been to. I have some work to do!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Miller Park (Milwaukee Brewers)</li>
    <li>Target Field (Minnesota Twins)</li>
    <li>U.S. Cellular Field (Chicago White Sox)</li>
</ul>
