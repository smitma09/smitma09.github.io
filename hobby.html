<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<h2>Baseball</h2>
<p>One of my favorite sports is baseball. I am a huge Twins fan, and try to get to at least a few games each year. One of my 
bucket list goals is to go to a game in every MLB ballpark. I've only been to a few, so I have a long ways to go. Here are the 
fields I have already been to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Miller Park (Milwaukee Brewers)</li>
    <li>Target Field (Minnesota Twins)</li>
    <li>U.S. Cellular Field (Chicago White Sox)</li>
</ul>
